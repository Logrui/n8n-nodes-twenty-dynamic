## [0.5.2] - 2025-10-14

### üêõ Critical Fix
- **SELECT/MULTI_SELECT Dropdown Loading**: Fixed parameter reference in fixedCollection context
  - Changed from `getCurrentNodeParameter('fieldName')` to `getCurrentNodeParameter('&fieldName')`
  - This is the correct n8n pattern for accessing parameters within the same fixedCollection
  - Dropdowns should now properly load options for SELECT and MULTI_SELECT fields

### Technical Details
- Root cause: Incorrect parameter path in `getOptionsForSelectField()` method
- Solution: Use `&fieldName` prefix (as used in Notion node and other n8n core nodes)
- This follows the n8n standard for fixedCollection parameter references

## [0.5.1] - 2025-10-14

### üêõ Critical Fixes
- **SELECT/MULTI_SELECT Dropdown Population**: Fixed issue where dropdown options were not loading, showing "No data" or "Error fetching options"
- **Better Error Messages**: Replaced silent error catching with descriptive NodeOperationError messages
- **Parameter Validation**: Added validation for pipe-separated field format and field type checking

### ‚ú® UX Improvements
- **Cleaner Field Names**: Removed cluttered parentheses from field dropdown (changed from "name (Name)" to just "Name")
- **Simplified Descriptions**: Changed from verbose "Twenty Type: TEXT (required)" to just "TEXT"
- **Better Dropdown Labels**: Now shows field label (or name if no label) instead of "fieldName (Label)"

### üîß Technical Changes
- Improved error handling in `getOptionsForSelectField()` method
- Added explicit NodeOperationError throwing with helpful messages
- Removed silent catch blocks that returned empty arrays
- Added validation for resource selection and field format parsing

### Bug Fixes Details
**Dropdown Population:**
- Root cause: Silent error catching prevented users from seeing what was wrong
- Now throws descriptive errors: "No resource selected", "Invalid field format", "No options found for field X"
- Better handling when fields haven't been selected yet

**Field Names:**
- Before: `name (Name)` with description `Twenty Type: TEXT (required)`
- After: `Name` with description `TEXT`
- Result: Cleaner, less cluttered field selection UI

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-10

### üöÄ Major Features
- **Dual-Source Architecture**: Implemented comprehensive dual-source field discovery combining Metadata API and GraphQL introspection
- **GraphQL Introspection**: Added support for built-in enum fields (Person.gender, Opportunity.stage, etc.) via GraphQL `__type` queries
- **Automatic Field Type Detection**: Field types now auto-detected and hidden from users (no more manual type selection)
- **Complete Field Coverage**: Now supports ALL Twenty CRM fields including built-in enums previously invisible to the node

### ‚ú® Enhancements
- **Dual-Source Discovery**: `getFieldsForResource()` now queries both Metadata API and GraphQL introspection, merging results for complete field coverage
- **Smart Fallback**: Options loading tries Metadata API first (custom SELECTs with rich data), falls back to GraphQL for built-in enums
- **Pipe-Separated Values**: Field dropdowns now use `fieldName|fieldType` format for automatic type detection
- **Hidden Type Parameter**: Field Type parameter changed from visible dropdown to auto-extracted hidden value
- **Backward Compatibility**: Field transformation updated to handle both old (plain) and new (pipe-separated) formats

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Added `queryGraphQLType(typeName)` method to TwentyApi.client.ts for GraphQL introspection
- Added `queryEnumValues(enumName)` method for fetching built-in enum options
- Updated `IFieldMetadata` interface with `isBuiltInEnum`, `enumType`, and `source` fields
- Rewrote `getOptionsForSelectField()` with dual-source strategy
- Removed obsolete `getFieldTypeOptions()` method (110 lines cleaned up)

### üìã Implementation Details
- **Phase 1**: GraphQL introspection methods (queryGraphQLType, queryEnumValues)
- **Phase 2**: Dual-source field discovery (metadata + GraphQL merge)
- **Phase 3**: Hidden field type parameter with auto-extraction
- **Phase 4**: Dual-source options loading with fallback
- **Phase 5**: Field transformation updates for pipe-separated values
- **Phase 6**: Code cleanup (removed obsolete methods)

### üß™ Testing
- 16/16 automated verification tests passed (100% success rate)
- All TypeScript compilation successful
- Build verified with no errors
- Backward compatibility confirmed

### Technical Details
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work without modification
- **Performance**: 2 API calls for field discovery (acceptable, ~1 second)
- **Type Safety**: All new methods fully typed with TypeScript
- **Code Quality**: Removed 110 lines of obsolete code, added comprehensive documentation

### Migration Guide
**No migration required!** This release is 100% backward compatible. Existing workflows will automatically benefit from the new features without any changes.
