# n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic

This is an n8n community node for **Twenty CRM** that uses dynamic schema discovery and enables working with Standard AND Custom data objects and fields.

üéØ **BETA VERSION - Approaching Production Ready** üéØ

**Current Status (v0.3.10):**
- ‚úÖ Dynamic schema discovery from Twenty CRM (metadata + GraphQL introspection)
- ‚úÖ All CRUD operations fully implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ Complex field types supported (FullName, Links, Currency, Address, Emails, Phones)
- ‚úÖ **Smart field selection** - Field Type suggestions based on Twenty's metadata
- ‚úÖ **Conditional field display** - only relevant fields appear based on Field Type selection
- ‚úÖ Clean, intuitive UI with no field clutter
- ‚úÖ Modular architecture for easy maintenance
- ‚úÖ Support for Standard AND Custom objects/fields
- üß™ **Beta testing** - Core functionality stable, additional features in development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production use with caution** - Test thoroughly in your environment first

**Recent Improvements (v0.3.x):**
- Field selection now shows Twenty field type + suggested n8n Field Type to use (v0.3.10)
- Added Emails field type (Primary Email) for person.emails and similar fields (v0.3.9)
- Added Phones field type (Primary Phone Number + Country/Calling Codes) (v0.3.9)
- Conditional display using path-based displayOptions - only relevant fields show (v0.3.8)
- Fixed annoying UX bug where 12+ fields appeared for every field selection (v0.3.8)
- Explicit field type selector - users choose Simple/FullName/Link/Currency/Address/Emails/Phones (v0.3.7-v0.3.9)
- Fixed critical n8n circular dependency bug preventing field additions (v0.3.6)
- Complex field types with template-based inputs (no more JSON editing!)
- Modular codebase with separate field parameter and transformation modules
- GraphQL introspection for accurate field type detection

**Known Limitations:**
- Advanced filtering UI still basic (can use expressions for complex filters)
- Emails/Phones field types only support primary fields (not additionalEmails/additionalPhones arrays)
- Some Twenty-specific field types may need additional handling (SELECT, MULTI_SELECT, RELATION, etc.)
- Relational fields work but UI could be improved

**Feedback Welcome:** This node is approaching production readiness. Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/Logrui/n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic/issues).

## About This Project

Unlike traditional n8n nodes with static operations, this node **dynamically discovers** the Twenty CRM schema at runtime. It queries the Twenty metadata API to automatically adapt to:
- All standard Twenty objects (Company, Person, Opportunity, etc.)
- Custom objects you've created in your Twenty instance
- Schema changes and updates without requiring node updates

**Key Architecture:**
- **Dynamic Schema Discovery:** Queries `/metadata` endpoint to get available resources and fields
- **Runtime Query Construction:** Builds GraphQL queries dynamically based on user selections
- **Native n8n Integration:** Uses `this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication` for all API calls
- **Intelligent Caching:** 10-minute TTL cache with force refresh option for optimal performance

[Twenty CRM](https://twenty.com/) is an open-source CRM under rapid development. This node aims to stay compatible through dynamic adaptation rather than static operation definitions.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Bug Reporting and Feature Requests

Please report bugs and request features on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Logrui/n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic/issues).

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Your Twenty CRM version
- Your n8n version
- The resource/object you're working with
- Steps to reproduce the issue

## Operations

This node dynamically discovers available objects from your Twenty CRM instance via the metadata API and GraphQL introspection.

**Supported Operations:**
- **Create One**: Create a new record with intelligent field inputs
- **Find One**: Retrieve a single record by ID
- **Update One**: Update an existing record (partial updates supported)
- **Delete One**: Delete a record by ID (permanent - cannot be undone)
- **Find Many**: Retrieve multiple records with pagination (up to 100 records)

**Dynamic Features:**
- Automatically discovers all standard Twenty objects (Company, Person, Opportunity, Task, Note, etc.)
- Supports custom objects you've created in Twenty
- Dynamically loads available fields for each object type (both standard and custom fields)
- Adapts to schema changes without node updates
- Field type validation and appropriate input controls

**Smart Field Inputs:**
- **FullName fields** (Person.name): Shows First Name and Last Name inputs instead of JSON
- **Links fields** (domainName, linkedinLink, etc.): Shows URL and Label inputs
- **Currency fields** (annualRecurringRevenue): Shows Amount and Currency Code inputs with dropdown
- **Address fields**: Shows individual inputs for street, city, state, postal code, country, and coordinates
- **Simple fields**: Standard text, number, date, and boolean inputs
- **Resource-aware**: Same field name behaves differently based on object type (e.g., Company.name is text, Person.name is FullName)

**Note:** Certain complex custom field types that are objects may still be work-in-progress. Please report any issues with custom fields on GitHub.

## Credentials

Generate an API key in Twenty by following the [Twenty docs](https://twenty.com/user-guide/section/functions/api-webhooks). In summary, create an API key in the Settings ‚Üí Developers section.

Copy the API key. Click 'Add Credential' in n8n and search for 'Twenty API'. Provide:
- **API Key**: Your Twenty API key
- **Twenty Domain**: Your Twenty instance URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `https://twenty.example.com`)

**Important:** Do _not_ use the 'API Base URL'. Use the root domain only (e.g., `https://twenty.example.com`, not `https://twenty.example.com/graphql`).

## Architecture

**Dynamic Schema Discovery:**
```
User Opens Node ‚Üí Check Cache (10min TTL) ‚Üí Fetch /metadata if stale
                                          ‚Üì
                              Parse Objects & Fields ‚Üí Build UI Options
```

**Query Construction Flow:**
```
User Selects Resource ‚Üí Load Fields Dynamically ‚Üí User Fills Values
                                                 ‚Üì
                              Build GraphQL Query String ‚Üí Execute via HTTP Helper
```

**Key Components:**
- `Twenty.node.ts`: Main node implementation with UI definition and operation handlers
- `TwentyApi.client.ts`: Helper functions for schema discovery and query building
- `FieldParameters.ts`: Centralized field parameter definitions for complex types
- `FieldTransformation.ts`: Data transformation logic (flat inputs ‚Üí nested GraphQL objects)
- `ComplexFieldDetection.ts`: Field type detection utilities
- `TwentyApi.credentials.ts`: Credential definition with caching support

**No External Dependencies:** All API communication uses n8n's native `this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication` method, following n8n best practices.

## Compatibility

This node is being developed and tested against:
- **Twenty CRM**: v0.40+ (tested with v1.0.3)
- **n8n**: v1.91+ (tested with v1.91.3)

Currently in beta testing phase. Compatible with both self-hosted and cloud instances of Twenty CRM.
