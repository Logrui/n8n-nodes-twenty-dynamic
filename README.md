This is an n8n community node that integrates **[Twenty CRM](https://twenty.com)** with fully **dynamic resource and field discovery**. It automatically adapts to your Twenty instance schema, including custom objects and fields, without requiring node updates.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

[Twenty CRM](https://twenty.com) is a modern, open-source CRM system built with GraphQL.

## Features

üóÑÔ∏è **Supports Custom Databases and Fields**: Automatically fetches all standard and custom objects from your Twenty instance  
üîì **Access System Databases**: View and edit system databases not normally accessible through the Twenty UI (Company/Person Attachments (attachments), Synced Email Metadata (messages), and more)
üîÑ **Dual-API Architecture**: Utilizes Twenty Metadata API and GraphQL introspection for complete field coverage for standard and custom fields. REST API used for execution of queries
‚ö° **Full CRUD + Bulk Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete, Upsert - all with bulk variants  
üß© **Complex Field Types**: Template-based inputs for FullName, Links, Currency, Address, Emails, Phones  
üìã **SELECT/MULTI_SELECT Fields**: Dynamic dropdowns with real-time option loading  
üíæ **Smart Caching**: Automatic schema caching - fresh on execution, cached in editor for speed

## About This Project

Unlike traditional n8n nodes with static operations, this node **dynamically discovers** the Twenty CRM schema at runtime. It queries the Twenty metadata API to automatically adapt to:
- All standard Twenty objects (Company, Person, Opportunity, etc.)
- Custom objects you've created in your Twenty instance  
- Schema changes and updates without requiring node updates

**Key Architecture:**
- **Dynamic Schema Discovery**: Queries `/metadata` endpoint to get available resources and fields
- **Hybrid GraphQL/REST**: GraphQL for mutations, REST API for efficient data retrieval
- **Runtime Query Construction**: Builds queries dynamically based on user selections
- **Intelligent Caching**: Fresh schema on execution, cached in editor UI for performance
- **Native n8n Integration**: Uses `this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication` for all API calls

[Twenty CRM](https://twenty.com/) is an open-source CRM under rapid development. This node stays compatible through dynamic adaptation rather than static operation definitions.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

**Quick Install in n8n:**
```
Settings ‚Üí Community Nodes ‚Üí Install ‚Üí n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic
```

**Or via npm:**
```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic
```

## Credentials

Generate an API key in Twenty by following the [Twenty API documentation](https://twenty.com/user-guide/section/functions/api-webhooks).

**Quick Steps:**
1. Open your Twenty instance
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Copy the generated key

**In n8n:**
1. Click **Add Credential** and search for **"Twenty API"**
2. Provide:
   - **API Key**: Your Twenty API key (from above)
   - **Twenty Domain**: Your Twenty instance URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `https://twenty.example.com`)

**Important:** Use the **root domain only**, not the GraphQL endpoint:
- ‚úÖ Correct: `https://twenty.example.com`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `https://twenty.example.com/graphql`

## Operations

This node dynamically discovers available objects from your Twenty CRM instance and supports the following operations:

### Single Record Operations

- **Create**: Create a new record with intelligent field inputs
- **Get**: Retrieve a single record by ID  
- **Update**: Update an existing record (partial updates supported)
- **Delete**: Delete a record by ID (permanent - cannot be undone)
- **Create or Update (Upsert)**: Smart upsert - create if not found, update if exists (match by ID or unique field)
- **List/Search**: Retrieve multiple records with pagination (up to 100 records)

### Bulk Operations

Process multiple records in parallel for maximum performance:

- **Create Many**: Bulk create multiple records (10-20x faster than sequential)
- **Get Many**: Retrieve multiple records by IDs in parallel
- **Update Many**: Bulk update multiple records with different field values
- **Delete Many**: Bulk delete multiple records by IDs
- **Create or Update Many (Upsert Many)**: Bulk smart upsert - create or update multiple records based on unique field matching

**Bulk Operations Benefits:**
- ‚ö° **10-20x faster** than sequential operations
- üõ°Ô∏è **Resilient**: Individual failures don't stop the entire batch
- üìä **Detailed results**: Each item returns success/error status with index tracking
- üîÑ **Parallel execution**: Uses `Promise.allSettled()` for concurrent processing

### Resource Selection
- **Database Group**: Filter databases by type
  - **All Databases**: Show all available objects (default)
  - **Standard Databases**: Main user-facing Twenty objects (Company, Person, Opportunity, Task, Note, etc.)
  - **System Databases**: Internal meta-objects (Views, Filters, Attachments, etc.) - Advanced users only
  - **Custom Databases**: User-created custom objects
- **Database**: Select the specific object/database to work with (dynamically filtered based on Database Group)

### Smart Field Inputs

The node automatically provides appropriate inputs based on field types:

- **FullName fields** (Person.name): Individual First Name and Last Name inputs
- **Links fields** (domainName, linkedinLink): URL and Label inputs  
- **Currency fields** (annualRecurringRevenue): Amount and Currency Code inputs with dropdown
- **Address fields**: Street, City, State, Postal Code, Country, and Coordinates inputs
- **Emails/Phones**: Multiple entry support with primary designation
- **SELECT/MULTI_SELECT**: Dynamic dropdowns with options from your Twenty instance
- **Simple fields**: Standard text, number, date, and boolean inputs
- **Resource-aware**: Same field name behaves differently based on object type (e.g., Company.name is text, Person.name is FullName)

### Supported Databases

**Standard Databases:**
- Companies, People, Opportunities, Tasks, Notes
- Workflows, Workflow Runs, Workflow Versions

**System Databases:**
- Attachments, Calendar Events, Messages, Message Channels, Note Targets, etc.

**Custom Databases:**
- ‚úÖ All custom databases you create in Twenty
- ‚úÖ Custom fields on standard objects
- ‚úÖ Most custom field types supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some complex object-based custom fields are work-in-progress

**Note:** The majority of custom fields are fully supported. If you encounter issues with specific custom field types, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/Logrui/n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic/issues).
