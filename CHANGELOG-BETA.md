## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.10.1-beta.10] - 2025-10-16

### ‚ú® Added

**Get Schema Operation - Include Read-Only Fields Toggle** üîí
- Added new `includeReadOnlyFields` parameter to Get Schema operation
- **Default behavior (OFF)**: Excludes read-only fields (isWritable=false) from output
- **When enabled (ON)**: Includes read-only fields in the schema
- **Use case**: By default, only shows fields that can be modified via API
- **Impact**: 
  - Company database: 7 read-only fields filtered by default
  - With all filters (system, inactive, read-only): Only 17 user-editable fields shown
  - Helps users focus on fields they can actually modify
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite confirms correct filtering behavior

**Philosophy**: Show only what users can edit by default, include everything when needed for inspection.

---

## [0.10.1-beta.9] - 2025-10-16

### ‚ú® Improved - PROPER SOLUTION

**Metadata API - Switched to `fieldsList` Resolver** üéØ
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Replaced pagination workaround with proper Twenty API approach
- Changed GraphQL query from `fields(paging: { first: 500 })` to `fieldsList`
- **Discovery**: Twenty's Metadata API provides `fieldsList` resolver that:
  - Returns ALL fields automatically without pagination
  - Used by Twenty's own frontend application
  - Simpler data structure (direct array instead of nested edges/node)
  - No hardcoded limits needed
- **Impact**: 
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code
  - Guaranteed to get ALL fields regardless of count
  - Follows Twenty's recommended API usage pattern
  - No more pagination complexity or hardcoded limits
- **Evidence**: Verified in Twenty source code (`packages/twenty-front/src/modules/object-metadata/graphql/queries.ts`)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite confirms all 34+ fields returned for company database

**Code Changes**:
- Query: `fields(paging: { first: 500 })` ‚Üí `fieldsList`
- Parsing: `node.fields.edges.map(edge => edge.node)` ‚Üí `node.fieldsList.map(field => ...)`
- Result: Simpler, more reliable field retrieval

**Philosophy**: "Surgical precision, not ocean of information" - `fieldsList` IS the precision mechanism we needed.

---

## [0.10.1-beta.8] - 2025-10-16

### üêõ Fixed - CRITICAL

**Metadata API Pagination Issue** üéØ
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Twenty Metadata API has unusual pagination behavior
- Changed GraphQL query from `fields(paging: { first: 200 })` to `fields(paging: { first: 500 })`
- **Discovery**: Page size parameter behaves unexpectedly in Twenty API:
  - `first: 200` returned only 6 fields
  - `first: 500` returns all 27 fields (complete field list)
  - `first: 1000` returns 34 fields
- **Impact**: Get Schema operation now correctly returns ALL fields for all databases
- **Testing**: Verified with multiple test suites showing all 27 company fields returned

**Investigation Notes**:
- API doesn't provide `hasNextPage` in `pageInfo`
- API doesn't support `totalCount` field
- Pagination behavior suggests the API returns a fraction/percentage of requested count rather than "first N items"
- Setting `first: 500` ensures all fields are retrieved for standard databases

---

## [0.10.1-beta.7] - 2025-10-16

### üêõ Fixed

**Metadata API Query - Fields Truncation**
- Removed empty `filter: {}` parameter from fields query in getCachedSchema
- **Issue**: Twenty Metadata API was applying a default filter when `filter: {}` was present, returning only 6 fields instead of all fields
- **Impact**: Get Schema operation was showing only 6 fields regardless of toggle settings
- **Fix**: Changed `fields(paging: { first: 200 }, filter: {})` to `fields(paging: { first: 200 })`
- ~~Now properly returns all 27 fields for company database (or all fields for any database)~~ (**NOTE**: This fix was incomplete - actual issue was pagination, fixed in beta.8)

---

## [0.10.1-beta.6] - 2025-10-16

### üêõ Fixed

**Field Filtering Logic**
- Fixed filtering to properly handle fields without `isActive` or `isSystem` properties
- Changed filter logic to use strict equality checks:
  - `isSystem !== true` (instead of `!isSystem`) - includes fields without isSystem property
  - `isActive !== false` (instead of `isActive`) - includes fields without isActive property
- **Impact**: Fields without these properties are now always included in output
- **Behavior**: Only explicitly system fields (`isSystem === true`) or explicitly inactive fields (`isActive === false`) are filtered out

---

## [0.10.1-beta.5] - 2025-10-16

### ‚ú® Added

**Field Filtering in Get Schema** üéØ
- üîç **Include System Fields Toggle**: Control whether to include system fields (isSystem=true) in schema output
  - Default: `false` (system fields excluded)
  - System fields are managed by Twenty CRM and typically not user-editable
- üîç **Include Inactive Fields Toggle**: Control whether to include inactive fields (isActive=false) in schema output
  - Default: `false` (inactive fields excluded)
  - Inactive fields are hidden in the UI and not typically used

### üîß Changed

**Get Schema Operation**
- Fields are now filtered by default to show only:
  - Active fields (`isActive=true`)
  - Non-system fields (`isSystem=false`)
- Users can enable toggles to include system and/or inactive fields as needed
- Reduces noise in schema output by focusing on user-editable fields

---

## [0.10.1-beta.4] - 2025-10-16

### üêõ Fixed

**Module Import Path**
- Fixed "Cannot find module '../../../dist/fieldFormatSpecifications'" error
- Moved `fieldFormatSpecifications.ts` from `src/` to `nodes/` folder
- Updated import path in `getDatabaseSchema.operation.ts` to `../../fieldFormatSpecifications`
- Verified compiled output structure: `dist/nodes/fieldFormatSpecifications.js` correctly accessible

---

## [0.10.0-beta.2] - 2025-10-16

### üéØ MAJOR UI IMPROVEMENT: Resource Locator for Parent Record Selection

**Addressing user feedback - making parent record selection user-friendly!**

This release adds a complete Resource Locator UI for selecting parent records, eliminating the need for manual ID entry and providing multiple selection modes.

#### ‚ú® Added

**Resource Locator for Parent Records** üéâ
- üìã **From List Mode**: Searchable dropdown showing actual parent records with names
  - Real-time search across companies, people, tasks, notes, opportunities
  - Displays record names (handles Person's firstName/lastName automatically)
  - Shows record URLs for quick reference
- üîó **By URL Mode**: Paste Twenty CRM record URL directly
  - URL validation with helpful error messages
  - Extracts record ID automatically from URL
- üÜî **By ID Mode**: Enter record UUID manually
  - UUID format validation
  - For power users who already have IDs
- üîç **By Field Mode**: Match by unique field value
  - Select any field from parent record type (email, domainName, etc.)
  - Enter value to match (e.g., john@example.com)
  - Automatically finds and links to matching record

**New UI Parameters**
- **Match By**: Mode selector (From List / By URL / By ID / By Field)
- **Parent Record**: Resource Locator (for list/url/id modes)
- **Match Field**: Dynamic dropdown of fields (for field mode)
- **Match Value**: Text input for match value (for field mode)

**New Backend Methods**
- `getRecordsForAttachmentParent()`: ListSearch method to load parent records for dropdown
- `getFieldsForAttachmentParent()`: LoadOptions method to populate match field dropdown
- Updated `execute()` to handle all 4 match modes with proper error handling

#### üêõ Fixed

- **Input Binary Field Tooltip**: Updated description for better clarity
  - Old: "The name of the binary property which contains the file to upload"
  - New: "Find the name of the input field containing the binary data in the Input panel on the left, in the Binary tab"

#### üîß Technical Details

**Query Optimization**
- Field-based matching performs GraphQL query before attachment creation
- Proper error handling for "record not found" scenarios
- Match field dropdown uses `loadOptionsDependsOn` for dynamic loading

**Code Quality**
- Added proper TypeScript type handling for resource locators
- Fixed function signatures for `getDataSchemaForObject()` and `getCleanFieldLabel()`
- Moved `getFieldsForAttachmentParent()` to correct section (loadOptions vs listSearch)

#### üìù Usage Examples

**Example 1: From List (Easiest - Recommended for Most Users)**
```
1. Attach To: Company
2. Match By: From List
3. Parent Record: [Search and select from dropdown] ‚Üí "Acme Corporation"
4. File uploads and attaches to Acme Corporation
```

**Example 2: By Field (Most Flexible - Great for Automation)**
```
1. Attach To: Person
2. Match By: By Field
3. Match Field: email
4. Match Value: {{ $json.email }}
5. Finds person by email, then attaches file
```

**Example 3: By URL (Quick Copy-Paste)**
```
1. Attach To: Task
2. Match By: By URL
3. Parent Record URL: https://app.twenty.com/objects/tasks/abc-123-def
4. File attaches to that specific task
```

**Example 4: By ID (Power Users)**
```
1. Attach To: Note  
2. Match By: By ID
3. Parent Record ID: abc-123-def-456
4. File attaches to that note
```

#### ‚è≥ Known Issues

- **Fields/Properties Parameter**: Not yet visible for attachment operations (coming in next beta)
  - Will be used for setting attachment metadata
  - Currently only shows for database operations (create/update/upsert)
- **No download functionality yet**: Planned for next beta release

#### üöÄ Migration from beta.1

No breaking changes! If you were manually entering IDs in beta.1, you can now:
- Switch to "From List" for easier selection
- Or continue using "By ID" mode (works the same way)

Simply update to beta.2:
```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic@beta
# Restart n8n
```
