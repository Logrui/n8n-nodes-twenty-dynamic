## [0.10.0-beta.2] - 2025-10-16

### üéØ MAJOR UI IMPROVEMENT: Resource Locator for Parent Record Selection

**Addressing user feedback - making parent record selection user-friendly!**

This release adds a complete Resource Locator UI for selecting parent records, eliminating the need for manual ID entry and providing multiple selection modes.

#### ‚ú® Added

**Resource Locator for Parent Records** üéâ
- üìã **From List Mode**: Searchable dropdown showing actual parent records with names
  - Real-time search across companies, people, tasks, notes, opportunities
  - Displays record names (handles Person's firstName/lastName automatically)
  - Shows record URLs for quick reference
- üîó **By URL Mode**: Paste Twenty CRM record URL directly
  - URL validation with helpful error messages
  - Extracts record ID automatically from URL
- üÜî **By ID Mode**: Enter record UUID manually
  - UUID format validation
  - For power users who already have IDs
- üîç **By Field Mode**: Match by unique field value
  - Select any field from parent record type (email, domainName, etc.)
  - Enter value to match (e.g., john@example.com)
  - Automatically finds and links to matching record

**New UI Parameters**
- **Match By**: Mode selector (From List / By URL / By ID / By Field)
- **Parent Record**: Resource Locator (for list/url/id modes)
- **Match Field**: Dynamic dropdown of fields (for field mode)
- **Match Value**: Text input for match value (for field mode)

**New Backend Methods**
- `getRecordsForAttachmentParent()`: ListSearch method to load parent records for dropdown
- `getFieldsForAttachmentParent()`: LoadOptions method to populate match field dropdown
- Updated `execute()` to handle all 4 match modes with proper error handling

#### üêõ Fixed

- **Input Binary Field Tooltip**: Updated description for better clarity
  - Old: "The name of the binary property which contains the file to upload"
  - New: "Find the name of the input field containing the binary data in the Input panel on the left, in the Binary tab"

#### üîß Technical Details

**Query Optimization**
- Field-based matching performs GraphQL query before attachment creation
- Proper error handling for "record not found" scenarios
- Match field dropdown uses `loadOptionsDependsOn` for dynamic loading

**Code Quality**
- Added proper TypeScript type handling for resource locators
- Fixed function signatures for `getDataSchemaForObject()` and `getCleanFieldLabel()`
- Moved `getFieldsForAttachmentParent()` to correct section (loadOptions vs listSearch)

#### üìù Usage Examples

**Example 1: From List (Easiest - Recommended for Most Users)**
```
1. Attach To: Company
2. Match By: From List
3. Parent Record: [Search and select from dropdown] ‚Üí "Acme Corporation"
4. File uploads and attaches to Acme Corporation
```

**Example 2: By Field (Most Flexible - Great for Automation)**
```
1. Attach To: Person
2. Match By: By Field
3. Match Field: email
4. Match Value: {{ $json.email }}
5. Finds person by email, then attaches file
```

**Example 3: By URL (Quick Copy-Paste)**
```
1. Attach To: Task
2. Match By: By URL
3. Parent Record URL: https://app.twenty.com/objects/tasks/abc-123-def
4. File attaches to that specific task
```

**Example 4: By ID (Power Users)**
```
1. Attach To: Note  
2. Match By: By ID
3. Parent Record ID: abc-123-def-456
4. File attaches to that note
```

#### ‚è≥ Known Issues

- **Fields/Properties Parameter**: Not yet visible for attachment operations (coming in next beta)
  - Will be used for setting attachment metadata
  - Currently only shows for database operations (create/update/upsert)
- **No download functionality yet**: Planned for next beta release

#### üöÄ Migration from beta.1

No breaking changes! If you were manually entering IDs in beta.1, you can now:
- Switch to "From List" for easier selection
- Or continue using "By ID" mode (works the same way)

Simply update to beta.2:
```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic@beta
# Restart n8n
```
