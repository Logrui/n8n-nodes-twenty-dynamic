# Implementation Plan: Attachment Management for Twenty CRM n8n Node

**Branch**: `002-attachment-management-upload` | **Date**: October 15, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-attachment-management-upload/spec.md`

**Note**: This implementation plan follows the `/speckit.plan` workflow and incorporates proven patterns from Google Drive v2 and Google Cloud Storage n8n nodes.

## Summary

This feature adds file upload and download capabilities to the n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic node, enabling users to automate file management with Twenty CRM. Users will be able to upload files from n8n workflows to Twenty CRM's file storage, attach them to CRM records (Companies, People, Tasks, etc.), and download attachments for downstream processing (emailing, archiving, analysis).

**Technical Approach**: Implement using n8n's binary data helpers (getBinaryStream, getBinaryMetadata, prepareBinaryData) with FormData multipart construction for GraphQL Upload scalar. Follow Google Drive v2 patterns for stream vs buffer detection and Google Cloud Storage patterns for multipart uploads. Maintain full backward compatibility by adding a Resource Group selector that preserves existing Database operations unchanged.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.5.3 (required by n8n-workflow peer dependency)
**Primary Dependencies**: 
- n8n-workflow (peer dependency - n8n's type system and helpers)
- **NO external dependencies** - Using Node.js 18+ built-in FormData

**Storage**: Twenty CRM handles file storage (Local/.local-storage or S3) - node is storage-agnostic  
**Testing**: Manual testing checklist (n8n node testing framework limitations) + unit tests for helper functions  
**Target Platform**: n8n >= 0.220.0 (requires binary data helper methods) + Node.js >= 18.10 (built-in FormData)  
**Project Type**: Single n8n node package (extends existing n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic)  
**Performance Goals**: 
- Handle files up to 50 MB without memory errors
- Stream large files (> 1 MB) from disk rather than loading into memory
- Resource locators populate within 3 seconds
- 99% upload/download success rate

**Constraints**: 
- MUST use n8n's binary data helpers exclusively (no direct Buffer operations)
- MUST NOT modify input data (n8n workflow immutability requirement)
- MUST use httpRequestWithAuthentication for ALL API calls (constitution requirement)
- MUST maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing Database operations
- File size limits enforced by Twenty CRM server-side (node respects these, doesn't enforce own limits)

**Scale/Scope**: 
- Single node with 2 resource groups (Databases, Attachments)
- 2 new operations (Upload File, Download File)
- 5 parent record types supported (Company, Person, Task, Note, Opportunity)
- Support all file MIME types (no restrictions)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Dynamic Schema Discovery ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status**: PASS - Not applicable to this feature
**Rationale**: Attachment operations use fixed Twenty CRM API endpoints (uploadFile mutation, attachment queries). No schema discovery needed for file operations. Parent record selection reuses existing dynamic schema infrastructure from Database operations.

### II. n8n Native Tooling ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status**: PASS - Full compliance with requirements
**Implementation**:
- ✅ Use `this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication()` for all GraphQL and REST API calls
- ✅ Use `this.helpers.assertBinaryData()` for binary validation
- ✅ Use `this.helpers.getBinaryStream()` and `this.helpers.getBinaryMetadata()` for large files
- ✅ Use `this.helpers.prepareBinaryData()` for binary output
- ✅ Use n8n credential system (`await this.getCredentials('twentyApi')`)
- ✅ Use `loadOptions` methods for parent record and attachment selection
- ✅ Use `loadOptionsDependsOn` for dynamic parent record loading based on "Attach To" type
- ✅ **NO external dependencies**: Node.js 18+ built-in FormData for multipart/form-data construction
- ✅ n8n's `IHttpRequestOptions.body` accepts FormData natively (proven by 10+ production nodes: SeaTable, TheHiveProject, Discord, Slack, BambooHR)

### III. User Experience First ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status**: PASS - Follows all UX conventions
**Implementation**:
- ✅ Field order: Credentials (auto) → Resource Group → Operation → Required → Optional
- ✅ Field naming: "Put Output File in Field" follows `<Action> <Type>` pattern
- ✅ Resource locators for all ID selections (From List, By URL, By ID modes)
- ✅ Terminology matches Twenty CRM UI ("Attachments", "Companies", "People")
- ✅ `noDataExpression: true` on Resource Group selector
- ✅ Descriptions include n8n expression guidance ("Choose from list or specify ID using expression")
- ✅ Hints for complex fields ("Large files stream from disk automatically")
- ✅ Dynamic field visibility with `displayOptions.show`
- ✅ Text styling follows constitution table: Title Case for displayName, Sentence case for descriptions
- ✅ Error messages include itemIndex for batch processing context

### IV. Relational Intelligence ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status**: PASS - Reuses existing infrastructure
**Rationale**: Parent record selection for attachments leverages existing relational intelligence from Database operations. New `getParentRecordsForAttachment()` loadOptions method follows established patterns for querying and presenting related records.

### V. Filter Builder Interface ⚠️ NOT APPLICABLE
**Status**: N/A - Feature doesn't require filtering
**Rationale**: Upload and Download operations work with specific records/files identified by ID or selection. No complex query filtering needed for attachment operations.

### VI. Semantic Versioning ✅ COMPLIANT
**Status**: PASS - Version bump planned
**Implementation**:
- Current version: 0.9.32 (PATCH - expression validation fix)
- Next version: 0.10.0 (MINOR - new feature, backward compatible)
- CHANGELOG.md will document: new Resource Group, Upload File operation, Download File operation
- No breaking changes: existing Database operations unchanged
- Migration path: None needed (fully backward compatible)

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure (Option 1). This is an extension to the existing n8n-nodes-twenty-dynamic package, not a new standalone project. All code additions integrate into the existing Twenty.node.ts file and TwentyApi.client.ts helper. No new nodes are created; this adds capabilities to the existing Twenty CRM Dynamic node.

## Complexity Tracking

*No violations - Constitution Check passed on all applicable principles*

This feature fully complies with the constitution:
- Uses only n8n native tooling (one justified external dependency: form-data)
- Maintains User Experience First with proper field ordering and text styling
- Implements proper semantic versioning (0.9.32 → 0.10.0 MINOR bump)
- Follows all n8n node standards and code quality requirements
- No complexity trade-offs required

---

## Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Research Already Completed

Comprehensive analysis of n8n's Google Drive v2 and Google Cloud Storage nodes has been completed and documented in:
- `docs/AttachmentsArchitectureLearnings.md` (600+ lines)
- `AttachmentsFeatureUpdate.md` (1700+ lines - planning document with code examples)

**Key Research Findings**:

1. **Binary Data Detection Pattern** (from Google Drive v2):
   - Decision: Use `binaryData.id` check to determine stream vs buffer
   - Rationale: Small files (< 1MB) stored in memory as base64, large files on disk
   - Implementation: `if (binaryData.id) { use getBinaryStream() } else { use Buffer.from() }`

2. **FormData Multipart Upload** (from Google Cloud Storage):
   - Decision: Use form-data npm package with proper headers and boundary
   - Rationale: GraphQL Upload scalar requires multipart/form-data with operations map
   - Implementation: 3-part structure (operations JSON, map JSON, file binary)

3. **Binary Download Encoding** (from Google Drive v2):
   - Decision: Set `encoding: 'arraybuffer'` and `json: false`
   - Rationale: Prevents binary data corruption during HTTP transfer
   - Implementation: Use prepareBinaryData() to convert Buffer to n8n format

4. **Helper Function Pattern** (from Google Drive v2):
   - Decision: Create getItemBinaryData() helper function
   - Rationale: Abstracts complexity of stream vs buffer detection
   - Implementation: Returns { content, fileName, mimeType, fileSize }

5. **Error Handling Standard** (from both Google nodes):
   - Decision: Include `itemIndex` in all NodeOperationError instances
   - Rationale: Critical for debugging batch processing failures
   - Implementation: `throw new NodeOperationError(this.getNode(), message, { itemIndex })`

**Alternatives Considered & Rejected**:

| Approach | Why Rejected |
|----------|--------------|
| Manual Buffer operations | n8n provides helpers specifically for binary handling - using them ensures compatibility |
| axios for HTTP | Constitution requires httpRequestWithAuthentication - provides auth, error handling, consistency |
| Resumable uploads for large files | Twenty CRM doesn't support resumable upload protocol; single multipart sufficient for <50MB |
| Custom binary data format | n8n has standard IBinaryData format - using it ensures downstream node compatibility |
| Implementing own multipart encoder | form-data package is battle-tested and used by n8n core - reinventing would be higher risk |

### Technology Choices Validation

All technology choices comply with constitution requirements:

- ✅ **TypeScript 5.5.3**: Required by n8n-workflow peer dependency
- ✅ **n8n binary helpers**: Constitution Principle II (n8n Native Tooling)
- ✅ **httpRequestWithAuthentication**: Constitution Principle II (mandatory)
- ✅ **form-data package**: Justified external dependency (GraphQL Upload multipart)
- ✅ **Resource locators**: n8n native UI framework
- ✅ **loadOptions methods**: n8n native dynamic dropdowns
