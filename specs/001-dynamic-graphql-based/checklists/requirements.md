# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic GraphQL-Based n8n Node for Twenty CRM

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ Specification focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- ✅ No technology stack mentioned (GraphQL mentioned only as Twenty CRM's API protocol, not an implementation choice)
- ✅ Business value clearly articulated in each user story
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete
- ✅ All 30 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ All 10 success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
- ✅ Success criteria are user/business-focused, not implementation-focused
- ✅ Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ 10 edge cases identified covering error conditions and boundary scenarios
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Assumptions section lists 6 key dependencies

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ 5 prioritized user stories (2 P1, 2 P2, 1 P3) cover complete feature scope
- ✅ Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
- ✅ 30 functional requirements map directly to user stories and edge cases
- ✅ No leakage of implementation details (caching mentioned as a requirement, not a technical solution)

## Notes

Specification is production-ready and meets all quality criteria. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization enables MVP-driven development (can deliver P1 stories first)
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage reduces implementation risks
3. Measurable success criteria enable objective validation
4. Technology-agnostic language ensures specification longevity

**No issues or concerns identified** - specification passed validation on first review.
